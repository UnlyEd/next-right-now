# Motivations

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Next Right Now (NRN) is meant to help you build **production-grade** projects using the **Next.js framework**.

NRN is maintained with several purposes in mind:

- To be used as a **boilerplate** to quickly deploy a **new** project.
    - It is used in production by [Unly](http://unly.org/), and thus covers enterprise-grade features and needs.
    - It has been used to build production-grade websites within 2h time during a French COVID-19 hackathon. (March 2020)
    - It has been used to build [Unly Solidarity](https://solidarity.unly.org/en), a fully static website meant to help French students find various solutions
      regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
    - It has been used to build [NRN Admin](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now-admin) _(Now unmaintained/discontinued)_
- To be used as an **educational** resource, meant to be used as a **learning/teaching** resource, even if you don't use it as a boilerplate.
- Provide various [presets](./concepts/presets), to help you getting started with the preset that matches the closest your needs.
- To be **flexible** and allow for extensive **customisation**, based on your own needs and use-cases.

Don't hesitate to share your opinion about your ["getting started"](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues/14) experience!

## Overview

This boilerplate is meant for developers with basic skills in React, who are looking for a way of building **production-grade web applications**. We took very
special care regarding the **Developer Experience**, because it's _very important to us, as developers,_ to help us build quality software.

Knowing Next.js, TypeScript and Vercel (formerly Zeit) vendor will be **a huge help**, because they are the pillars of this boilerplate.

> We carefully explain installation and proper setup, but **it's your responsibility to go deeper and actually learn how they work**.

> **Tip**: Bookmark this [React Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/react) if you're new to React.

> **Tip**: Bookmark this [TypeScript Cheat Sheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/setup) if you're new to TypeScript.

### Presets, opt-in features and 3rd party vendors

**Next Right Now** provides multiple presets, which provide different features that rely on different vendors. Don't hesitate to check out
our ["What's a preset?"](./concepts/presets) section for more information.

Each preset provides different "built-in" features and utilities. Therefore, you probably want to get an overview of all
the [available presets](./available-presets) to decide which one best fit your needs.

> Want to know why we decided to provide presets? See our [RFC specifications](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues/18).

## Benefits

As mentioned above, **each preset has its own set of built-in features**. Even though, there is a **common base of features that are available on all presets**:

Here is an overview of all the features included in this boilerplate:

### Common features (available in all presets):

- **Stages** (development, staging, production)
- **TypeScript** advanced support
- Various **rendering** capabilities, which allow for **hybrid** configuration
    - Next.js allow [per-page rendering configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), meaning you can build hybrid SSG/SSR apps
- React hooks over HOC (functional components over classes)
- **Testing** advanced support
    - TS-friendly (thanks to [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest))
    - End-to-end (E2E) automated tests (thanks to [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and Github Actions), with TS support
    - Other tests, such as unit tests, etc. (thanks to [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Jest extended](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended))

        - Including a dedicated "per-branch domain", for fast feedback loop and testing means, in an online environment with a url which is automatically updated as
        new pushed commits are being deployed (staging)
    - **Webhook endpoint invoked once a Vercel deployment has been deployed** _(since December 2020)_
        - _At Unly, we use it to update the Customer data stored in Airtable.
          Then, this information is useful to our Customer Success team to know what version each of our customers uses and whether they're up-to-date between staging and production!_
    - **Automated GitHub tags and [releases](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/releases)** _(since December 2020)_
        - All changes landing into a non-preset branch are automatically tagged and released as pre-release (the pre-release points to the latest commit on the branch)
        - All changes landing into a preset branch are automatically tagged and released
- Built-in **API endpoints**
    - An [`/api/status`](https://nrn-v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty-c1.vercel.app/api/status) endpoint to showcases some environment variables that are built-in and ready to use (Git metadata (SHA, branch, tag), deployment date, AWS metadata (region, node version, memory) etc.)

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- `advanced support`: This means we took very special care to support this, and that it's not as simple as one might think.
- <sup>1</sup>: Third parties that provide a free plan that is sufficient for a "simple" application, **but** make sure to check that their pricing fits you.
- **<sup>2</sup>**: Beware, there is a huge gap between free and paid plans cost.
- **<sup>3</sup>**: Does not provide a free plan, only a free trial.
