# XXX Template example
# This file is an example, meant to be duplicated as ".env.development.local" for local override

# See https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables

# XXX Tips: How is this file meant to be used?
# This file is NOT tracked by git and can contain sensitive information, or override variables from ".env.development".

# XXX Tips: When is this file being used?
# This file is used only during development (localhost).
# For staging/production stages, the app relies on "now.{NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_REF}.{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_STAGE}.yml:build.env".

# XXX Tips: What's the difference between env vars starting with "NEXT_PUBLIC_" and the others?
# All env variables that DON'T start with "NEXT_PUBLIC_" MUST be manually exposed by ./next.config.js for the project to work locally
# "NEXT_PUBLIC_" has a semantic purpose. If you mean to use a variable on the browser, then you should use "NEXT_PUBLIC_".
# Any non-sensitive env variable should start with "NEXT_PUBLIC_".
# Sensitive information MUST NOT start with "NEXT_PUBLIC_".
# You must be careful to use sensitive information only on the server-side, because if you use them on the browser or getInitialProps, they'll be leaked, even if the variable doesn't start with "NEXT_PUBLIC_".
# Any change to this file needs a server restart to be applied.
