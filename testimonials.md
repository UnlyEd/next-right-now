> "We initially built our app with Create React App and as our product evolves we needed to have a solid SEO.
> We planned to migrate to NextJS, but it looked very time-consuming to set up everything again.
> Here's come Next Right Now providing a complete boilerplate with great tools already integrated like Sentry or Locize.
> TypeScript, with good typings, is the icing on the cake.
> It helps us a lot to move quickly on NextJS." - [ApplyFuture](https://www.applyfuture.com/), _2020-10_
