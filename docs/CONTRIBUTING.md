# Contributing

## Contributing about documentation

Our documentation lives in the `docs/` folder. It is generated by Github Pages.

Only the master branch generates the online documentation. It is available at [https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/](https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/)

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) behind the wheel, and [`just-the-docs`](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme for Jekyll.

### Installing Jekyll locally

In order to contribute to the docs, you may need to install Jekyll locally (especially for non-trivial changes).
Jekyll needs Ruby binary.

1. Install and configure Jekyll on your computer, follow [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
1. Once Jekyll is installed, you can install all Ruby gems using `yarn doc:gem:install`
1. Once gems are installed, you can run Jekyll by using `yarn doc:start`

### Configuring Jekyll properly

Jekyll configuration uses 2 different files.
- [`docs/_config.yml`](docs/_config.yml) used by Github Pages
- [`docs/_config-development.yml`](docs/_config-development.yml) used by your local installation

There are a few, but important differences between both. The custom configuration must be written at the top of each config file.
The shared configuration must be written below.

> **N.B**: If you add custom/shared configuration, don't forget update both config files, as needed.
