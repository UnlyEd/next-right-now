This short tutorial will explain how to perform a super quick local installation (for local-only testing purpose, without deploying anything online)

This tutorial uses the [**`v1-ssr`**](../getting-started/select-preset) preset, which is the ~~simplest~~ _only one_ available at this time.

> It doesn't really matter if the selected preset fits your needs, the goal here is to give your a tour of what NRN can do for you, as quickly as possible.

## Step by step installation

{% include installation-guide-quick-start.md preset=v1-ssr %}

### Advanced configuration

{% include installation-guide-tips.md %}
