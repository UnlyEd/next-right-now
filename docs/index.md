# My GitHub Pages docs site

Hello! Welcome to your docs site that comes built-in with NRN :smiley:

Take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](./contributing) section about how to install/run those docs locally.

All the documentation you need about how to build your own docs site is available at [`just-the-docs`](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).

If you want to look at a more complex example, take a look at the [NRN docs source code](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/tree/gh-pages)!

One small difference though, NRN docs lives at the / folder, because it uses gh-pages, but the built-in docs that comes with a NRN preset are in the `docs/` folder instead.

Using a `gh-pages` or `master` dedicated branch, or using your `master` branch `docs` folder really is up to you, you can choose what option you want on your GitHub Settings pages, in the **GitHub Pages** section.

By default, GitHub won't use your `/docs` folder, until you manually configure it.

> You can definitely leave this folder be for now on, and keep it around for a later use, or remove it altogether.
> It's completely unrelated to the rest of this boilerplate and won't have any side effect.
