# Roadmap and future improvements

> This boilerplate is usable (and used) in production environments. But there are a few improvements we're really looking towards.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
    - This feature has been [officially released](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3) and we plan on building a SSG variant ASAP.
    ~~This feature is currently in [RFC draft](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/9524) and being developed on the Zeit framework.
    It's gonna be a huge game changer for Next.js, because it will allow statically generated apps that are still dynamic.
    It's similar of what Gatbsy allows, but it will be much more powerful and flexible, as we will be able to enable SSG on a page basis.
    This means that on the same app, some page may use SSR, other may use SSG, etc.
    We are closely watching this RFC, as we hope to change the boilerplate to handle such use case.~~
- **Admin frontend backoffice**: [Currently in progress](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now-admin)
