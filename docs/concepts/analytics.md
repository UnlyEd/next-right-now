# Analytics

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Analytics uses data and math to answer business questions, discover relationships, predict unknown outcomes and automate decisions. This diverse field of computer science is used to find meaningful patterns in data and uncover new knowledge based on applied mathematics, statistics, predictive modeling and machine learning techniques.

No matter what you plan to accomplish with analytics, the first requirement for any analytics project is data. Once you have data, you need to analyze that data. And then you need to deploy the results of your analysis to drive decision making.

Analytics is meant to allow you to collect and process metrics of the application.

For instance, you may want to know how many people visited your homepage, or how many came back more than twice within the same month.

Regarding analytics, it's as very important to:
- Collect actionable data (focus on business KPIs)
- Build comprehensive data analysis charts
- Setup automated reports of your most important KPIs to help take important strategic decisions and initiatives

Building a business without any analytics is similar to driving a car with your eyes closed.

It is a pillar to any serious business website, and it is quite complicated to do it right. Tools matter!

> NRN promotes the usage of Amplitude vendor.

It's simply the best one we've worked with over the past 2 years.

It's much more flexible than Google Analytics. Also, it plays much better with isomorphic apps and SPA.

If you want fine-grained control over the data you want to collect, it's the perfect tool for the job.

Also, it provides a really great react package.
