# Testing

## CI tests Workflow

Zeit will automatically run the tests before deploying, as configured in the `yarn build` command.

> If any test fail, the deployment will be aborted. This ensures that any code that doesn't pass the tests never get deployed online.

Once a deployment has been deployed on Zeit, **Github Actions** will run our **E2E tests**, to make sure that the app behaves as expected.
This can also be considered as an integration tests suite.

## Running tests manually (locally)
You can run interactive tests using Jest with `yarn test` script.

## Running E2E tests manually (locally)
You can run interactive E2E tests using Cypress with `yarn e2e:open` script.

You can also run them non-interactively using `yarn e2e:run` script.

> You may need to run `yarn e2e:install` script first
