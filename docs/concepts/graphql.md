## Fetching data from GraphCMS

There are several ways of fetching data from a GraphQL API:
- [`react-hoc`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hoc/): HOC (High Order Components) can be used with an components (classes, functional), the GraphQL query is described in the function's wrapper, outside of its body.
    **Former way, tend to be deprecated in favor of `react-hooks` nowadays.**
    [List of known issues](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#caveats).
- [`Render Props`](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html): Never used it, fixes some issues one can encounter with HOC, but hooks are still better.
- [**`react-hooks`**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks): Hooks can only be used with Functional components (not classes), the GraphQL query is described in the function's body.

We used the hooks approach because it's just cleaner and simpler to understand.
