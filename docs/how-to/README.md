# How-to

> In this section, you'll learn "how to" do something.

We use categories, such as "analytics", "i18n", "testing" to regroup items together.
For each item (i.e: analytics), we explain how to:
- Configure it (step by step tutorial about initial setup and must-know configuration settings)
- Use it (links to official docs and overview explanation)
- Remove it (explanation about what packages to remove and where/how source code is impacted)
