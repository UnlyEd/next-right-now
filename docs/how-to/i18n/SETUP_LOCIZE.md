## Creating Locize account

> Creating a Locize account is **necessary** to run the application, even when running it locally, because the app will throw an error if the `LOCIZE_PROJECT_ID` is not valid.
>
> **Tip**: You can skip this step if you use the default `LOCIZE_PROJECT_ID`, but note that new keys won't be created automatically because `LOCIZE_API_KEY` isn't valid

- [Create a free (2w trial) account on Locize](https://www.locize.app/register?ref=unly-nrn)
- Make sure to keep `i18n format: i18next/locizify` (by default)
- Make sure to select `publish format: json nested`
- Add French and English languages (french is required for the demo to work properly)
- Add a `common` namespace (and removed the default `latest` namespace)
- (Optional) Update the [`referenceLng`](src/utils/i18nextLocize.ts) (set to `fr` for the demo), you can leave it to `fr` if you created a French version in Locize
- (Optional) Add a `production` version, you won't need it if you don't deploy to production
    - Set the `Cache-Control max-age` header value _(ex: `86400`)_ for the `production` version (performances + cost)
- Copy the `Project Id` and `API Key` from the Locize settings page to the [`.env.build`](.env.build) (`LOCIZE_PROJECT_ID` and `LOCIZE_API_KEY` respectively)
    - The `LOCIZE_PROJECT_ID` is required for the app to fetch the translations
    - The `LOCIZE_API_KEY` is required for the app to automatically create missing keys to Locize, when working locally ([See `saveMissing` option](src/utils/i18nextLocize.ts))
        **This key is sensitive and must not be shared publicly, as it would allow anyone to update your translations through the API.** (it's not injected in the DOM when not working locally, so you're safe for now)
- That's it! Your Locize project is setup and ready to use!
