## TypeScript Cheat Sheet

We strongly recommend you read through [TypeScript Cheat Sheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/setup), it's such a great piece of work and should help you alongside your TS journey, whether you're experimented or a beginner.

> You don't need to focus on "how to configure" TS, because that's already done by NRN.
