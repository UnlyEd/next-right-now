Next Right Now
===

Next Right Now (NRN) is meant to help you build **production-grade** projects using the **Next.js framework**.

NRN is maintained with several purposes in mind:
- To be used as a **boilerplate** to quickly deploy a **new** project.
    - It is used in production by ourselves, and thus covers enterprise-grade features and needs.
    - It has been used to build production-grade websites within 2h time during a French COVID-19 hackathon. (March 2020)
    - It has been used to build [NRN Admin](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now-admin)
- To be used as an **educational** resource, meant to be used as a **learning/teaching** resource, even if you don't use it as a boilerplate.
- Provide various boilerplate [presets](./concepts/presets), to get started with the preset that matches the closest your needs.
- To be **flexible** and allow for extensive **customisation**, based on your own needs and use-cases.

Don't hesitate to share your opinion about your ["getting started"](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues/14) experience!

# Documentation

There are several sources of documentation:
- [**General documentation**](https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/) contains general documentation about the NRN project.
    - Great to learn about our concepts and get an overview of all features NRN has to offer
- **Demo documentation**, which is different for each preset and showcases built-in features within that preset.
    - Great to see code usage examples

Both documentations are related and there are many links from the demos toward the general doc.

# Testimonials

> "We initially built our app with Create React App and as our product evolves we needed to have a solid SEO.
> We planned to migrate to NextJS, but it looked very time-consuming to set up everything again.
> Here's come Next Right Now providing a complete boilerplate with great tools already integrated like Sentry or Locize.
> TypeScript, with good typings, is the icing on the cake.
> It helps us a lot to move quickly on NextJS." - [ApplyFuture](https://www.applyfuture.com/), _2020-10_
