Next Right Now
===

> Next Right Now (NRN) is meant to be used as a boilerplate for quick getting started with a production-grade project featuring the Next.js framework, hosted on Zeit platform.
>
> NRN is strongly opinionated, but also very flexible.
> It can also be used as a learning/teaching resource.
>
> A lot of built-in components and utilities are available out of the box. Keep those you like, throw what you dislike, rewrite what doesn't exactly fit your needs, and share what could be useful to others! ;)
>
> Don't hesitate to share your opinion and propose improvements

# Overview

This boilerplate is meant for developers with solid React background, who are looking for a way of building **production-grade web applications**.
We took a very special care about the **Developer Experience**, because it's very important to build quality software.

Knowing Next.js, Zeit and/or GraphQL will be **a huge help**.
We explain how to install them and properly setup them, but **it's your job to go deeper and actually learn how they work**.

This boilerplate includes must-have built-ins such as **i18n, GraphQL, Next.js, TypeScript, monitoring, CI/CD pipeline (dev > staging > production), unit tests, end-to-end tests, analytics and various utilities**.

There are a lot of things, and some of them rely on third-party providers.
There are so many tools out there and we've chosen them based on our personal opinion (and experience/experiments), while keeping in mind that **you may have a different opinion**, and may want to use something else.

Thus, **you can still use this boilerplate even if you don't like all our choices**, because you can simply [get rid of what you dislike](README_HOW_TO_REMOVE.md).

# Benefits

- **B2B multi-tenants** (AKA **"monorepo"**) first-class support (optional, **advanced use-case**)
  - Supports configuration, deployment, testing, monitoring of multiple customers through the same project (identical code base, monorepo design)
  - This is a very special consideration, and required quite a lot of efforts to make it works smoothly
    - With multi-tenants setup, we don't use the native **Zeit <> Github integration**, but our **custom Zeit <> Github Actions integration** instead ([.github](.github))
  - Most projects do not need such capability, but we build our own projects with such requirement in mind, and thus released NRN with such built-in capability
  - **It's very easy not to use it** if you don't need to, but it'll be a huge time saver for you if you need it!
- Built-in **stages** (development, staging, production) workflow
- **TypeScript** first-class support
- **GraphQL** support (thanks to [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), and others)
  - **GraphCMS** first-class support, which hosts our GraphQL API (server) and database, fully hosted (thanks to [GraphCMS<sup>1</sup>](https://graphcms.com/?ref=unly-nrn))
  - **GraphQL schema** available in the developer environment (thanks to [GraphQL Config](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-config))
- **SSR** and **CSR** capabilities (thanks to the [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org/))
- React hooks over HOC (functional components over classes)
- **Internationalisation** (i18n) first-class support (SSR + CSR friendly) (thanks to [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/))
  - I18n of the database (thanks to [GraphCMS<sup>1</sup>](https://graphcms.com/?ref=unly-nrn))
      - [Automated fallback language, through HTTP headers](https://graphcms.com/features/content-localization/?ref=unly-nrn)
  - I18n of the project (thanks to [Locize<sup>1</sup>](https://locize.com/?lng=en))
      - [Automated fallback language](https://www.i18next.com/principles/fallback)
      - [In-context editor](https://docs.locize.com/more/incontext-editor)
      - Auto-add i18n keys with default translation when working locally
- **Testing** first-class support
  - TS-friendly (thanks to [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest))
  - End-to-end (E2E) tests (thanks to [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/))
  - Other tests, such as unit tests, etc. (thanks to [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Jest extended](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended))
- Strong **observability** of the system (monitoring) and push-notification on your own messaging channel (i.e: Slack) when things go wrong (thanks to [Sentry<sup>1</sup>](https://sentry.io/))
- **Universal JS**, to re-use code as much as possible between frontend and backend (i.e: universal cookies API)
- Powerful **CSS-in-JS** styles, SSR & CSR friendly, JSX-friendly, styled-component friendly (thanks to [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion))
- **Font** first-class support (SSR/CSR friendly, no FOUT effect) (thanks to [WebFontLoader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader))
- Fine-grained frontend **analytics**, react-friendly, flexible, SPA-friendly (thanks to [Amplitude<sup>1</sup>**<sup>2</sup>**](https://amplitude.com/))
- **Integrated CI/CD pipeline**, automated deployments to preview domains and production domains (thanks to the [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions))
  - Including a dedicated "per-deployment domain", for fast feedback loop and testing means, in an online environment (staging)
  - Including a dedicated "per-branch domain", for fast feedback loop and testing means, in an online environment with a url which is automatically updated as new pushed commits are being deployed (staging)
- Built-in **utilities**
  - Convert SVG to TSX components (thanks to [SVGR](https://github.com/gregberge/svgr))
  - Font Awesome icons as react components, with SSR support (thanks to [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome))
  - Bootstrap support (thanks to [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/))
  - Node debug mode for the server side (only built-in on WebStorm)
  - NPM security audit (script)
  - NPM developer-friendly outdated packages (script)
  - Display warning on outdated browsers, works even if bundle isn't ES5 compatible (IE11, etc.)
  - Use Zeit secrets for sensitive information
- [Fully documented usage of all our third party NPM libraries (AKA dependencies)](./README_DEPENDENCIES.md)

**Legend:**
- `first-class support`: Means that we took a very special care to support this, and that it's not as simple as one may believe
- <sup>1</sup>: Third parties that provide a free plan that is enough for a "simple" application, but make sure to check that their pricing fits you.
- **<sup>2</sup>**: Beware huge gap between free and paid plans cost.

# Roadmap and future improvements

> This boilerplate is usable (and used) in production environments. But there are a few improvements we're really looking towards.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
    - This feature is currently in [RFC draft](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/9524) and being developed on the Zeit framework.
    It's gonna be a huge game changer for Next.js, because it will allow statically generated apps that are still dynamic.
    It's similar of what Gatbsy allows, but it will be much more powerful and flexible, as we will be able to enable SSG on a page basis.
    This means that on the same app, some page may use SSR, other may use SSG, etc.
    We are closely watching this RFC, as we hope to change the boilerplate to handle such use case.
- **Admin frontend**
    - We are planning on releasing another OSS boilerplate featuring [React-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin), which is another OSS framework.
    The goal is to provide a boilerplate similar to this one, only this time it'll be a BackOffice on top of a GraphQL API.
    [Our first POC](https://github.com/Vadorequest/react-admin-graphql-boilerplate) was released a few months ago and the next step is to go further.
    Our secret goal would be to automatically generate all the BackOffice CRUD views dynamically, by using the GraphQL schema (but it seems quite a bit complicated).

---

# Understanding `Environments` and `Stages`

> The application relies on environment variables to function correctly.
> Those variables are provided differently depending on the environment.

When working on the `development` environment (localhost), the variables from [`.env.build`](.env.build) are used by [the webpack configuration](./next.config.js),
also, the [`now.json`](./now.json) configuration file is used _(it's a symlink to [`now.customer1.staging.json`](now.customer1.staging.json))_, but the variable defined in `.env.build` take precedence.

When deploying an instance to the Zeit's platform, the variables used are the one that belong to that instance, such as:
- `yarn deploy:customer1`: This script will deploy an instance using the [`now.customer1.production.json`](now.customer1.staging.json) file.
- `yarn deploy:customer1:production`: This script will deploy an instance using the [`now.customer1.production.json`](now.customer1.production.json) file.

> In those files, it's the `build.env` part that is used at build time (build is done on Zeit), which basically replaces all references of every environment variable by the actual value (string replace).

## What is an `environment`?

> An environment is "where" the application is running.
> It can be either "development" (localhost) or "production" (on Zeit's servers).
>
> **The `environment` is defined by the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.**
>
> **N.B**: It is not possible to any other value, [as enforced by Next](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/master/errors/env-key-not-allowed.md)

When working on your local computer, you automatically use `NODE_ENV=developement`.

The environment affects how the application **is bundled**, it is used at **build time**. (webpack, hot-reloading, etc.)

> i.e: In `development` environment, you have access to PropTypes warnings, but you won't in `production`.

## What is a `stage`?

> A stage is "how" the application is running.
> It can be either "development" (localhost), "staging" or "production" (on Zeit's servers) - _You can add more if you need_
>
> **The `stage` is defined by the `APP_STAGE` environment variable.**
>
> **N.B**: You can use any stage name you like, there is no restriction.

- When working on your local computer, you automatically use `APP_STAGE=developement`.
- When creating a Zeit preview deployment (i.e: when pushing a commit/branch (CD), when using `yarn deploy`, etc.), you automatically use `APP_STAGE=staging`.
- When creating a Zeit production deployment (i.e: when using `yarn deploy:customer1:production`, when merging a PR to `master`, etc.), you automatically use `APP_STAGE=production`.

The stage changes the behaviour of the application, because we sometimes need the application to behave differently depending on the stage.

> i.e: In `production` stage, the Locize configuration uses the `production` version.
> When using another stage, it uses the `latest` version.

> i.e: We don't want to enable the same level of debugging in production environment.
> For instance, Locize is configured to be in `debug` mode only in non-production stages.

# I18n (Internationalization)

The content displayed on NRN is translated using different ways, depending on where the translations are stored:
- GraphCMS - Dynamic content (fetched from the DB, through GraphCMS API). This content can be updated through GraphCMS backoffice.
- Locize - Static content (fetched from Locize API). This content can be updated through Locize backoffice, or when using in-context editor.

## Fetching translations through GraphCMS

> When the content is fetched through GraphCMS, the content is automatically internationalized using the `gcms-locale` **HTTP header** provided in the HTTP request.
>
> This means that a given user will not fetch the same content (even though the GraphQL query is identical) based on the `gcms-locale` value.

The `gcms-locale` value is a string of the form `'FR, EN'`. _([case matters!](https://graphcms.com/docs/api/content-api/?ref=unly-nrn#passing-a-header-flag))_
There is two locales defined in this example _(there can be more, but we only handle 2 locales at this time in this app)_.
- `FR` is the first and main locale. Content in French will therefore be loaded first.
- `EN` is the second and is a fallback locale. If the content is not found in the main locale, then fallback locales are used.

See the [official documentation](https://graphcms.com/docs/api/content-api/?ref=unly-nrn#passing-a-header-flag) to learn more.

> **N.B:** Even though it is possible to also specify the language `per field`, our **default approach** is to translate all content at once based on the header,
> because it's so much simpler, and handles automated fallback, which is very useful if the content is not defined in the primary requested language.

## Fetching translations through Locize provider

> When the content we want to display doesn't come from GraphCMS API, then it's considered as a "static" content.
>
> This means that the content is managed by [Locize](https://locize.com?ref=unly-nrn) and must be updated manually there.

Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NOzJhgmyQE) to see Locize in action with react-i18next.

### Locize translation workflow in-depth

The Locize project contains two different **versions**:

- `latest`: This **Locize version** is used in **any non-production application stage** (development, staging). That's where translations get added/updated by translators.
- `production`: This **Locize version** is only used in the production application stages (`APP_STAGE=production`) _(all customers share the same `production` version in the current setup, for the sake of simplicity)_

> This separation between the two versions is important and very useful to avoid deploying unapproved changes to the production stage.

In order to update the `production` version, all changes must go through the `latest` version.
They can therefore be tested during the development phase, then during the staging phase.
Once you're ready to ship the content to production, the `production` version can be updated from the `latest` version, which will automatically update all customer production stages.

> **Tip**: New i18n keys are added automatically in the `development` stage, as they are being added to the source code, thanks to the `saveMissing` [option](src/utils/i18nextLocize.ts). _This can also be a bit boring with HMR, because useless keys may be created while programming._

#### Locize additional services

Locize provides a few [additional services](https://locize.com/services.html?ref=unly-nrn). Some are free, some are paid.

#### Other additional services

- One interesting thing is the ability to share part of the project to be translated by a third party using [`Crowdbased`](https://locize.com/services.html?ref=unly-nrn), without sharing the whole project.
- There are also several paid [Translation services](https://locize.com/services.html?ref=unly-nrn), where you can pay people to translate your content.
- It is also possible to enable [Audit](https://locize.com/services.html?ref=unly-nrn), which allows to audit every change to our translations, and keep changes up to 10 years. (_expensive_)

# [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/?ref=unly-nrn)

## Discount

> Using the coupon code **`unly-nrn`** will grant you a 3-month 15% discount on the premium plans.

## Fetching data from GraphCMS

> We use multiple libraries to fetch data from GraphCMS. GraphCMS provides a GraphQL endpoint, so we use generic libraries to the GraphQL specification like `react-apollo`.
>
> [See full list of dependencies related to GraphCMS](README_DEPENDENCIES.md)

There are several ways of fetching data from a GraphQL API:
- [`react-hoc`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hoc/): HOC (High Order Components) can be used with an components (classes, functional), the GraphQL query is described in the function's wrapper, outside of its body.
    **Former way, tend to be deprecated in favor of `react-hooks` nowadays.**
    [List of known issues](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#caveats).
- [`Render Props`](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html): Never used it, fixes some issues one can encounter with HOC, but hooks are still better.
- [**`react-hooks`**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks): Hooks can only be used with Functional components (not classes), the GraphQL query is described in the function's body.

We used the hooks approach because it's just cleaner and simpler to understand.

---

# [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) (Analytics)

> Amplitude is used to collect usage metrics (analytics) of the application.

Amplitude **is used only on the frontend part of the application**. It is composed of two parts:
- [`@amplitude/react-amplitude`](https://github.com/amplitude/react-amplitude): React components easy to use, see their [blog post](https://amplitude.engineering/introducing-react-amplitude-d7b5258bc708).
- [`amplitude-js`](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript): The JS SDK, only compatible from the browser. (They're working on making it [compatible with SSR](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript/issues/164))

See the [documentation example at react-amplitude](https://github.com/amplitude/react-amplitude#example-instrumenting-tic-tac-toe-from-facebooks-intro-to-react-tutorial) to understand how it's meant to be used.
We only use react-amplitude to manipulate events.

> **Known limitation**: Amplitude doesn't provide any backend-compatible API. See https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-JavaScript/issues/164

## Chrome developer debug tool

> The amplitude team has released a Chrome plugin to see the events from the browser.
>
> It is a **must-have** when working with Amplitude. It's very simple to use and quite helpful.

# Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## Overview

> Every time a commit is pushed to the repository, or a branch is merged, automated actions are triggered.
>
> Those actions are managed through Github Actions

## Workflow of our Zeit <> Github Actions integration

Here is how the multiple steps are ordered:

1. [Event] A commit is pushed, a branch is merged (or on any change made on the remote repository)
1. [Trigger] Our [Github Actions](./.github/workflows) are triggered
    - Either the staging scripts is executed, or the production script, depending on which branch is impacted (see [Github Actions <> Zeit integrations](./.github/workflows/README.md))
    - No matter what script (production vs staging) gets executed, those actions are always triggered:
        1. A new Zeit deployment is triggered, which runs our tests first (`yarn test:once`) (Failing tests will stop the deployment)
        1. Then, the deployment is deployed, and automatically linked to a custom domain which depends on the git branch name (xxx.now.sh)
        1. Then, our 2E2 tests are triggered using Cypress
            - If they fail, artifacts (screenshots, videos) recorded by Cypress are uploaded to Github to help further debug (See [example](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/runs/474607960))

## In-depth project's dependencies

See [README_DEPENDENCIES](./README_DEPENDENCIES.md)


---

# Testing

## CI tests Workflow

Zeit will automatically run the tests before deploying, as configured in the `yarn build` command.

> If any test fail, the deployment will be aborted. This ensures that any code that doesn't pass the tests never get deployed online.

Once a deployment has been deployed on Zeit, **Github Actions** will run our **E2E tests**, to make sure that the app behaves as expected.
This can also be considered as an integration tests suite.

## Running tests manually (locally)
You can run interactive tests using Jest with `yarn test` script.

## Running E2E tests manually (locally)
You can run interactive E2E tests using Cypress with `yarn e2e:open` script.

You can also run them non-interactively using `yarn e2e:run` script.

> You may need to run `yarn e2e:install` script first
