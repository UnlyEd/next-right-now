Cypress End-to-end tests suite (E2E)
===

This `cypress` folder is used for E2E testing.

Read more about [the folder structure](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Folder-Structure)

- `_examples`: Tests created by Cypress during initial install (initially located in `integration/examples`), they've been moved to this folder so that they don't run but can still be used as learning resource
- `integration`: The folder where tests must be written
- `screenshot`/`videos`: Will contain assets when tests fail, useful during development. When tests are executed by Github Actions, you'll find those assets under the "Artifacts" section. (e.g: https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/runs/862302266)
- `fixtures`: Fixtures are used as external pieces of static data that can be used by your tests. (We've kept the fixtures installed during the Cypress initial install)

## Cypress config files

The files `cypress/config-*` are used for different purposes.

- `config-customer-ci-cd.json`: This file is a mock config file used by CI/CD GitHub Actions by the workflows `deploy-vercel-production.yml` and `deploy-vercel-staging.yml`.
    The `baseUrl` is a fake value (required by Cypress, but not used) which is replaced at runtime by the real `baseUrl` which is a dynamic Vercel deployment url.
- `config-development.json`: This file is only used when running `yarn e2e:run` and `yarn e2e:open` locally.
  It uses `baseUrl=http://localhost:8888` which is where our local server is running. It's only meant for local testing
- `config-$CUSTOMER_REF.json`: This file is only used when running `yarn deploy:$CUSTOMER_REF` locally. _It is not used by CI/CD workflows._

## Tests ordering

[Sanity Checks](./integration/app/_sanity/README.md) are executed first. Then, tests are executed by their folder/file alphabetical order by default.

## Officiel Cypress recommandations

> We see organizations starting with Cypress by placing end-to-end tests in a separate repo.
> This is a great practice that allows someone on the team to prototype a few tests and evaluate Cypress within minutes.
> As the time passes and the number of tests grows, we strongly suggest moving end-to-end tests to live right alongside your front end code.
>
> This brings many benefits:
>  - engages developers in writing end-to-end tests sooner
>  - keeps tests and the features they test in sync
>  - tests can be run every time the code changes
>  - allows code sharing between the application code and the tests (like selectors)
