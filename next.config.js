   * React's Strict Mode is a development mode only feature for highlighting potential problems in an application.

   * We strongly suggest you enable Strict Mode in your Next.js application to better prepare your application for the future of React.
   *
   * If you or your team are not ready to use Strict Mode in your entire application, that's OK! You can incrementally migrate on a page-by-page basis using <React.StrictMode>.
