# About Vercel

We love Vercel, and it's really a great help to deploy web apps. They basically took something very powerful but complicated like AWS and made it
developer-friendly while providing a great developer experience.

Although, we were a bit wary about some changes they made in April 2020 and decisions made by the Vercel team, in particular regarding
their [2020 April Pricing changes](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/4029), and we led a discussion about it.

Even though, they've made huge positive changes in the last 6 months of 2020, and we believe they'll take the web as we know it to yet another level.

Also, Vercel is behind the Next.js framework.

They recently [announced a $40M funding](https://vercel.com/blog/series-b-40m-to-build-the-next-web) Series B.
