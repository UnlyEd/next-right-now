# About Stacker

[Stacker](https://stacker.app/?ref=unly-nrn) is a very flexible way to build your own Back Office, CRM, or any admin tool, whether internal, external, or both.

> At Unly, we use it to manage our customers using a UI we built ourselves (no-code), while allowing our customers to manage their own content, using a UI we built specifically for them.
>
> Back in early 2020, we spent a few months testing various solutions (Strapi, Directus, GraphCMS, etc.) of "Headless CMS".
>
> After much intense testing, we selected Stacker as our back-office software partly because **it's the most flexible tool we had found**.
