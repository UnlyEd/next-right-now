## Tips

You can get your first month for free using the [`nrn1m` coupon code](https://studio.airportal.app/register?coupon=nrn1m). Note that Stacker is free until you deploy your app to production and start having customers using it.

If you want to build a POC, it's a great opportunity!

## Create Stacker account

- [Create a free account on Stacker](https://studio.airportal.app/register?coupon=nrn1m)
    - Select which database you want to use, you can use either Airtable, Google Sheets or SalesForce
        - My advice is to go with Airtable if you're just playing around or don't intend to have more than 1.2k records (it's free up to that limit)
        - If you're interested about Airtable, [here is how to get $2k credits for $50](https://www.joinsecret.com/fr/offers/airtable-coupon-1800) (I've personally used it!).
        - Google sheets may be a more viable option if you intend to have tons of rows in your DB
