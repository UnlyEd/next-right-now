NRN comes with one built-in demo per preset, each demo showcases the important features and utilities that are built-in within the selected preset.

Therefore, each demo is slightly different for each preset.

> While a demo is great at showcasing features and explaining concepts, but you'll most likely want to tear it down to build your own app instead.
>
> We explain how to do that below.

Here are a few of the existing demo:
- [`v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty`](../../available-presets/v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty#demo)
- [`v2-mst-aptd-gcms-lcz-sty`](../../available-presets/v2-mst-aptd-gcms-lcz-sty#demo)
