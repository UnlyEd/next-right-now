## Interactive debug mode

In order to use step-by-step debugging (AKA "interactive debug"), there is a special configuration to apply to WebStorm IDE.

You can start the project in **debug mode** [by running the WebStorm "Debug" configuration in debug mode](https://youtu.be/3vbkiRAT4e8)

Beware that this will only allow for back-end debugging.
Frontend debug should be performed from the browser itself.
