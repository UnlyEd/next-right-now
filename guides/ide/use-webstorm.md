## About WebStorm

We use [WebStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) because it's one of the best out there, and we're very used to it.

Therefore, we will provide **advanced WebStorm advices and configuration**.

> This is a personal preference and **you can use any IDE** of your choosing with NRN.
>
> If you don't know what IDE to use, then we advise using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is completely free, and wonderful too.


As of 2021, we recommend either:
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (paid, free for students)
- or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free, OSS)

> Please contribute and share tips about your IDE, if you wish to see NRN provide advanced advices and configuration for other tools, such as VSCode.

## Interactive debug mode

In order to use step-by-step debugging (AKA "interactive debug"), there is a special configuration to apply to WebStorm IDE.

You can start the project in **debug mode** [by running the WebStorm "Debug" configuration in debug mode](https://youtu.be/3vbkiRAT4e8)

Beware that this will only allow for back-end debugging.
Frontend debug should be performed from the browser itself.
