## Creating Sentry account

- **Tip**: If you don't want to create an account, you can use `https://14fa1cae05079675b18cd05403ae5c48@sentry.io/1234567` as `SENTRY_DSN`, it will not catch any error, but it will allow for online deployment

- [Create a free account on Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/?ref=unly-nrn)
- Create a new project
    - Select "React" as project type
    - **Tip**: You **should** create only one project, even if you use a multi-tenants setup, because all customers will be using the same error monitoring project
- You can find your Sentry DSN at [https://sentry.io/settings/TEAM_NAME/projects/PROJECT_NAME/keys/](https://sentry.io/settings/TEAM_NAME/projects/PROJECT_NAME/keys/)
- If you have already configured Vercel, and if you want to deploy your app online, you must also configure Vercel secrets
    - `vercel secrets add nrn-sentry-dsn YOUR_SENTRY_DSN`

That's it! Your Sentry account is ready to use!
