## Overview

> Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript. [https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)

Next.js provides CSS-in-js using [`styled-jsx`](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx), but we dislike it for several reasons.
It's not very intuitive to write styles that way and it needs extra dependencies/configuration to work with nested components and such.

Instead, we use [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) in this project,
which allows to write components using either the `styled` notation, or the `css` notation.

It's strongly recommended to read the [official documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) about how to use it.

### Note about `/** @jsx jsx */`

When using Emotion, the file must start with `/** @jsx jsx */` on top of it.

- [Official doc](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop#jsx-pragma)

> **TL;DR** _It basically tells the babel compiler to do something different and won't work if not specified._

## Dependencies
