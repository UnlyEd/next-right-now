This short tutorial will explain how to perform a super quick (~5mn) local installation (for local-only testing purpose, without deploying anything online)

This tutorial uses the [**`{{ site.nrn_default_preset }}`**](../available-presets) preset.

> It doesn't really matter if the selected preset fits your needs, the goal here is to give you a tour of what NRN can do for you, as quickly as possible.

## Step-by-step installation
