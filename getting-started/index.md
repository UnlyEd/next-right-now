# Getting started

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
This section contains everything about how to get started with Next Right Now, as a boilerplate for your own project.
</div>

---

Here is the order we recommend:

1. [Pre-requisites](./pre-requisites): Make sure all required tools are installed.
1. [Quick start](./quick-start): Quickly get started with a preset and run it on your own computer under 5mn.
1. [Video tutorials](./video-tutorials): Check our video tutorial to get an overview of what using NRN really looks like, from a developer point of view. _(Early 2020, `v1`, outdated)_

## Want more?

- [Demo DB structure](../reference/demo-database-structure): Understand the database structure used for the demo (Airtable, GraphCMS).
- [Vendors pricing](../reference/vendors): Overview of the vendors pricing and what you should be aware of.

## Want some real fun?
