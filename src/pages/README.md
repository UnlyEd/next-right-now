# Next.js pages

[Official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

## Native optimisations

Next.js automatically optimise the page client build based on whether they implement `getStaticProps` (SSG) or `getServerSideProps` (SSR).

For instance, all code within `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` is automatically stripped from the browser bundle. But, it's also the case for
top-level `import` that are only used within those functions.

### Visualise bundle optimisation

[https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/) will help you visualise the difference between the code you write and what's
actually bundled into the client.

Example with:

- [`[locale]/pageTemplateSSG`](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/s/hc9SWg_fj)
- [`[locale]/pageTemplateSSR`](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/s/M0oIDdQJ2)
- [`[locale]/demo/native-features/example-with-ssg-and-fallback/[albumId]`](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/s/nejeyE9MH)

> You'll notice for both those files that server-side module imports (such as `ApolloQueryResult`) are completely stripped from the client-side build.
>
> Also, for `[albumId]`, relative imports such as `songs` are also automatically stripped!
