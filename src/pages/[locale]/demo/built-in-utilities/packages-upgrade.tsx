        <Alert color={'warning'}>
          Upgrading packages is a necessary step in any non-trivial application.<br />
          And upgrading any package, even to a <code>patch</code> version, <b>can result in a completely broken app</b>.<br />
        </Alert>

        <p>
          In order to reduce risks associated with packages, we've made some very opinionated decisions about how to handle our dependencies, by default.<br />
          Those decisions are based on years of experience with production systems, and are meant to avoid breaking production apps unexpectedly.<br />
          <br />
          First of all, we only install <b>fixed</b> versions.<br />
          For example, <code>"@amplitude/react-amplitude": "1.0.0"</code>, the <code>"1.0.0"</code> is a fixed version, it won't change unless we manually/expressively do it.<br />
          We don't use any automation like <code>"^1.0.0"</code> or <code>"&gt;1.0.0"</code><br />
          <br />
          Also, we configured NPM/Yarn to
          <ExternalLink href={'https://stackoverflow.com/a/30659125/2391795'}>always install fixed versions by default</ExternalLink>
          using <code>npm config set save-exact true</code><br />
        </p>

        <Alert color={'success'}>
          Using only fixed versions ensures there won't be any packages difference between your development, staging and production environments.<br />
          This alone reduces the risks tremendously. Coupled with <code>yarn.lock</code> file, it makes your deployments much safer.
        </Alert>

        <p>
          In order to simplify packages upgrade, we provide a small utility tool (which is nothing more than an alias to a <code>yarn</code> command that too few people know about).

        <p>
          The main advantage of upgrading your packages this way is that it's <b>interactive</b>.<br />
          You can go through all packages using up/down keyboard arrows, and select those you want to update by pressing the space bar.
        </p>

        <Alert color={'danger'}>
          We strongly recommend to <b>upgrade packages one by one</b>, instead of multiple packages at once.<br />
          And then, commit each change independently, and push them independently too.<br />
          This alone, will save you tons of time if any package creates a regression, because even if you don't catch the regression immediately
          (it may only affect part of your UI/workflow that isn't covered by any automated test).<br />
          Then you'll still have the ability to compared each deployment afterwards, and figure out when did the regression occur first, and thus know which package caused it.<br />
          <br />
          Doing this will definitely <b>save you hours</b> of digging around compared to a easy massive upgrade of all deps at once.<br />
          <br />
          To save up some time, we recommend grouping related packages upgrade together. For example, we usually upgrade all apollo-related packages at once. <br />
          Not only it reduces the amount of commits/pushes/deployments, but also it makes sense because sometimes those related package are meant to be updated together.<br />
          It's usually the case with eslint, react, typescript, etc. In the end, it's up to you to learn what feels right to group together.

          It's <ExternalLink href={'https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/pull/27'}>exactly how we do it</ExternalLink>
          and it has saved us quite a few hours.<br />
          If you look at the above PR, you'll notice we did some 31 commits to update 39 packages in total.<br />
          We ran into very tough bugs (crossed regression caused by 2 different packages, one of them through a <code>patch</code> version upgrade)&nbsp;
          and it would have been very hard (not to say impossible) to figure out the root cause if we had upgraded everything at once.
