          Fetching APIs works slightly differently depending on whether you use SSG or SSR.<br />
          <br />
          When you're using SSG, all queries are executed from the server side, during build generation, on your computer or your CI server.<br />
          When using SSR, queries are executed on the fly, from the client or from the server depending on how the page is served (CSR vs SSR).<br />
          <br />
          Therefore, you need to be careful about tokens and other <b>credentials</b> you might use.
          And you also need to consider performances (e.g: running all queries at once)<br />
          <br />
          The below examples will focus on SSG, because that's what we recommend to use. But know that you may use both.<br />
          Also, you might want to run GraphQL queries from the browser even when using SSG, it's also possible but we don't provide such example at this time.

          The above code is what we actually use in <code>getCommonStaticProps</code>, to fetch data that are shared by all SSG pages.

                  label

                    ...themeFields // This uses a GQL fragment (code reusability)
                  }
                }
              }
              \${theme.themeFields} // Fragment(s) import
            \`;
          `}
        />

        <p>
          All our pages fetch some data from GraphCMS, because we need those in shared components (i.e: Footer, Nav)
