        <Alert color={'info'}>
          Next.js doesn't come with a built-in stages configuration. It doesn't know about the concept of "stage". <br />
          But it does help you about handling ENV vars, and Vercel helps about handling secrets.<br />
          It's a bit complex to get it right though, and that's where NRN comes in, to help you configure this and keep it simple.<br />
          <br />
          Secrets are
          <ExternalLink href={'https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables'}>securely stored</ExternalLink>
          on Vercel.<br />
        </Alert>

        <div>
          Our setup puts the best of Vercel and Next together, it works differently depending on the stage.<br />

          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>development</code>:
              All your secrets and env vars are configured in the <code>.env.build</code> file.<br />
              When you're working locally, you're working on one project at a time.<br />
              Thus, all the config is located in a single file.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>staging</code> and <code>development</code> stages:
              Your env vars are configured in the <code>vercel.*.json</code> files, per customer and per stage.<br />
              Env vars are basically hardcoded in those files, while secrets are referenced there, but nobody can read their value.<br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Overall, we made it easy to use: Just hardcode your non-sensitive env vars in <code>vercel.*.json</code> and store your sensitive secrets on Vercel, that's it.
        </div>

        <Alert color={'warning'}>
          Beware about the <code>"environment variables"</code> term, which may mean something different whether you mean it locally, or on Vercel.<br />
          <br />
          Before, only <code>secrets</code> existed, but since <code>now@18</code> they've introduced the concept of <code>environment variables</code>.<br />
          It can be a bit hard to understand how the 2 should be used together.<br />
          Basically put, <code>secrets</code> are global and shared across all projects, while <code>env vars</code> are scoped by project.<br />
          <ExternalLink href={'https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/4065'}>There are other differences</ExternalLink>, though.<br />
        </Alert>

        <Alert color={'info'}>
          This new "environment variable" feature made things more complicated to comprehend, in our opinion.<br />
          Therefore, we recommend to use the term <code>secrets</code> for everything that's securely stored on Vercel, and the term <code>environment variables</code> for everything that's not securely stored (git tracked, readable from code files).
