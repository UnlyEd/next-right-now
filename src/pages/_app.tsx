 * This file is the entry point for all pages, it initialize all pages.

 * It can be executed server side or browser side.
 * It can be executed from a static build (SSG) or dynamically per request (SSR).
 *
 * We use "_app" to handle root errors and configure common behaviours and configurations across all pages. (it inits sentry, by importing our helper)
 * Some of those behaviours/config are applied based on the runtime engine (browser vs server) and on the rendering mode (dynamic vs static)
 *
 * NRN Definitions:
 * - Universal: A universal code (AKA isomorphic) runs anywhere (on both browsers and servers), it is compatible with both, but may behave slightly differently
 * - Multiversal: A multiversal code is universal (runs anywhere) and also handles all rendering modes (dynamic and static)
 *    The concept of "Multiversal" has been invented by myself, because we lack proper definition for this kind of things (it's fairly new, feel free to propose better)
 *    It's very important for developers to know when a particular piece of code is gonna be executed (server? browser? static? dynamic request? etc.)
 *
 * Next.js provides huge capabilities, but with such comes complexity.
 * You may have a hard time knowing for sure if a particular function will run identically on browser + server + statically + dynamically
 * For instance, if you depend on cookies, then you'll have a different behaviour whether executing the code:
 *  - During the SSG rendering (server side, but no request and no access to user-data or request-data)
 *  - During a server side request (no access to browser data (localstorage, browser cookies)
 *  - During a client side request (no access to server data (server cookies, HTTP headers)
 *
 * XXX It's easy to get lost. The term of "Multiversal" is used to make it obvious that a particular piece of code runs in any situation.
 *
 * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app Custom _app
 * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript#custom-app TypeScript for _app
