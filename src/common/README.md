Common

> Check out the [documentation about the folder structure](../README.md#common-folder)

Summary:
- This folder uses an MVC-ish design pattern, where you split your files in separated folders, depending on their kind.
- This folder is great to quickly write some piece of code, you don't need to think a lot about how organized your code should be, and can get started quickly.
- If you don't know or are unsure whether to go for `common` or `modules`, pick `common`. You can always change your mind later.
