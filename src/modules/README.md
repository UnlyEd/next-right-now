Modules
===

> Check out the [documentation about the folder structure](../README.md#modules-folder)

Summary:
- This folder contains modules.
- `src/modules/core` contain modules built-in with NRN, so you can easily differentiate your own code with NRN's code.
- Modules are a way to organize your code, by putting all related files together, instead of splitting them by "kind".
- You don't need to use modules.
- You should use modules if you feel like it's the right thing to do.
- Don't try to convert everything as a module at once, take it slow, discuss with other team members.
- If you're not sure, use `common` instead, and come back later if needed.
