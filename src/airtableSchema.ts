/**
 * Airtable database schema used thorough the whole app.
 *
 * This schema describes all fields of our local model, which maps the fields returned by the Airtable API.
 * All tables you want to fetch must be described below.
 *
 * Each table describes the fields that should be fetched.
 * Fields that aren't described will not be fetched.
 *
 * Each field can describe its own data processing.
 *
 * XXX This function can be called from the client and the server.
 *  But, in practice, it's only called by the server.
 *  Hence, all "transformations" function are only called on the server-side.
 *  Be mindful of that when manipulating fields that are computed by Airtable.
 *  Because fields that are computed by Airtable will become "stale" in production.
 *  Time-related fields in particular, are very subject to that:
 *    - e.g: fields based on a computed property "isExpired" will be correct when fetched, but will become stale afterwards, and aren't reliable.
 *  This is a concern for the production environment only, as staging/development use real-time API requests and thus use up-to-date content.
