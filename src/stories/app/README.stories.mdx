<div className="subheading">Custom components</div>

Next Right Now doesn't enforce a particular way to write your components **stories**, but we've got some advices:
- `src/stories/sb-examples` contains the default Storybook examples. They contain useful links and resources you should probably keep around.
- `src/stories/nrn` contains Next Right Now components. Feel free to delete those you don't need them! We suggest keeping the Storybook documentation for those you use.
- `src/stories/app` is for you, you can rename it, split it into several folder, do as you want.

> We suggest not renaming Next Right Now and Storybook existing stories if you plan on using Next Right Now as a boilerplate, as it would make sync with NRN harder.

<div className="subheading">Folders and stories</div>

Folders don't dictate in which section your stories will be displayed.

> You can have different folders within `src/stories` publishing stories in the same section, it depends on the Story `title`, not its file path.

Therefore, you could mix NRN native components with your own (put them in the same section but in different folders), if you'd like to do it this way.

<div className="subheading">Storybook configuration documentation</div>

Many efforts have been put into Storybook configuration documentation.

The best place to start discovering what Next Right Now has done for you are:
- `.storybook/main.js`: Describes all the addons being installed and why. With links to their respective documentation.
- `storybook/manager.js`: Describes the Storybook UI customization.
- `storybook/preview.js`: Describes the Storybook "component preview" configuration.
It is the "story preview entrypoint" and contains the whole Preview configuration.
  - It's where you can customise the `storySort`, to manipulate the ordering of the stories.
