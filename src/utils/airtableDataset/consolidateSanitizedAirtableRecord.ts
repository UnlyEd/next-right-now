/**
 * The default is meant to be a safety net to avoid resolving too many relationships down the tree.
 *
 * When resolving nested relationships, it's possible to run into "max circular references" (100 circular calls).
 * Defining a max depth resolution helps avoiding this.
 *
 * Note that you could use a high value if needed (e.g: 5), but it will take A LOT of time to compute.
 * Also note that if the generated size is too big, it'll go over the 6MB AWS and even though it'd work locally, it'd fail on Vercel.
 * It might not be "too much of an issue" if you're only using static pages (SSG, without preview mode), but it'd slow down development quite a lot though.
 *
 * XXX We recommend keeping 2, because that's just enough to create circular dependencies that will allow you to use deeply-nested properties from relationships.
 *  No need to go deeper than 2 in most cases. 3-4 would be acceptable but won't change anything in most apps, besides making them slower.

/**
 * XXX DEPRECATED - Prefer using consolidateSanitizedAirtableDataset instead
 * Consolidate a single sanitized airtable record.
 *
 * Resolves all relationship fields within the record.
 * The relationships will create circular references.
 *
 * Due to the circular references, the result must be serialized using Flatten.stringify before being sent to the browser.
 * Then, the browser must deserialize using Flatten.parse, to allow the consolidated record to be rebuilt from the browser once it has transited through the network.
 *
 * TODO This is not optimised. A better way of doing things would be to go through the whole dataset and create circular references by resolving each relationship.
 *  Then, the whole dataset would be consolidated, and any record would be too.
 *  Also, only the consolidated dataset would have to be serialized, not dataset + customer record. I'd divide memory consumption by ~2.
 *
 * XXX Experience feedback:
 *  After spending days on this, there are 2 ways to go with circular references and nested relationships
 *  1) Update the source dataset by reference (mutate) while consolidating the record:
 *    => This has the huge advantage of building circular references, which is great if you need to access deeply nested data.
 *    => You can't JSON.stringify the result though, because of the circular references.
 *    => You can't send it from the server to the browser either, because serialisation using JSON.stringify will fail.
 *    => But you can use Flatten.stringify to serialize it safely from the server, and Flatten.parse to deserialize it safely from the browser.
 *    => It will eat the minimal amount of memory, because references don't take memory space, as they're just pointers.
 *    => That's what we eventually decided to do.
 *  2) Not mutate the source dataset, but only the record:
 *    => There are no circular reference because each relationship is a deep clone, but you can only go as deep as you cloned them.
 *    => You can JSON.stringify the result.
 *    => You can send it from the server to the browser.
 *    => It will eat a HUGE amount of memory, which depends on how many depth level you go.
 *      Tests have shown 150Ko, 250Ko, 550Ko, 5Mo, 12Mo, 180Mo of space taken by a dataset of 150 entities, from depth 1 to 6.
 *      Mind that more than 6Mo will crash Vercel, because AWS limit is 6Mo of (total) data from server to browser.
 *    => That's what we did at first and it's not the way, it's unreliable and unoptimized.
 *  The best way seems to use circular references and serialize the result into a string that gets sent to the browser and deserialized there.
 *  This way, the server does all the work (but it does it once, when generating the static page) and the browser perfs are better.
 *  Also, the memory consumption is much lower than alternative 2), which was crashing Cypress due to an out-of-memory issue.
