/**
 * Fetch translations from Locize API
 *
 * We use a "common" namespace that contains all our translations
 * It's easier to manage, as we don't need to split translations under multiple files (we don't have so many translations)
 * (that may be a bit more optimized to split them under different namespaces, but that feels like anticipated optimization that isn't needed atm)
 *
 * We don't use the Locize backend for fetching data, because it doesn't play well with Next framework (no serverless support)
 * @see https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next/issues/274
 *
 * Instead, we manually fetch (pre-fetch) the translations ourselves from the _app:getInitialProps, so that they're available both on the client and the server
 * @see https://github.com/i18next/i18next/issues/1373
 *
 * XXX Make sure you don't use "auto" publish format, but either "nested" or "flat", to avoid the format to dynamically change (I personally recommend "nested")
 * @see https://faq.locize.com/#/general-questions/why-is-my-namespace-suddenly-a-flat-json
 *
 * XXX Caching is quite complicated, because the caching strategy depends on the runtime engine (browser vs server) and the stage (development, staging, production)
 * For instance, we don't want to cache in development/staging, but we do for production in order to improve performances and decrease network usage
 * Also, we want to invalidate the cache as soon as a new version is deployed, so that the end-users get the latest version immediately
 * (and avoid missing translations due to new content for which there wouldn't be any translation because we'd still be using a cached version)
 * @see https://github.com/i18next/i18next/issues/1373
 *
 * Explanation about our cache implementation:
 *  - Browser:
 *    * In-memory: Once the translations are fetched from Locize, they're memoized
 *      - Development/staging stages:
 *        - It's very useful in development/staging, where we don't have any browser caching enabled, because it'll reduce the API calls
 *          With this in-memory cache, the Locize API will be hit only once by the browser, and then the in-memory cache will take over when performing client-side navigation
 *        - The in-memory cache will be invalidated as soon as the page is refreshed (F5, cmd+r, etc.) and a new API call will be made
 *    * Browser's native cache:
 *      - Development/staging stages:
 *        - The browser's cache is completely disabled in development/staging, so that we may work/test with the latest translation
 *          See the official recommendations https://docs.locize.com/more/caching
 *      - Production stage:
 *        - When in production, the browser will also cache for 1h, because we configured a "Cache-control: Max-Age" at https://www.locize.app/p/w7jrmdie/settings
 *          We followed the official recommendations https://docs.locize.com/more/caching
 *          1h seems to be a good compromise between over-fetching (we don't expect our users to use the app for more than 1h straight)
 *          and applying translation "hot-fix" (worst case: "hot-fix"" be applied 1h later, which is acceptable)
 *        - The browser's native cache will be invalidated as soon as a new release of the app is deployed,
 *          because the value of "build" in the "loadPath" url will change and thus the browser will not use its cached version anymore
 *  - Server:
 *    * In-memory: Once the translations are fetched from Locize, they're memoized
 *      - Development:
 *        - Once the translations are memoized, they'll be kept in-memory until the server restarts
 *          Note that HMR will clear the cache, meaning any source code change that triggers a new build will thus invalidate the cache
 *      - Staging/production:
 *        - Once the translations are memoized, they'll be kept in-memory until... God knows what.
 *          - It's very hard to know how/when the memoized cache will be invalidated, as it's very much related to AWS Lambda lifecycle, which can be quite surprising
 *          - It will likely be invalidated within 5-15mn if there aren't any request performed against the Lambda (nobody using the app)
 *          - But if there is a steady usage of the app then it could be memoized for hours/days
 *          - If there is a burst usage, then new lambdas will be triggered, with their own version of the memoized cache
 *            (thus, depending on which Lambda serves the requests, the result could be different if they don't use the same memoized cache)
 *            This could be the most surprising, as you don't know which Lambda will serve you, so you may see a different content by refreshing the page
 *            (if browser cache is disabled, like when using the browser in Anonymous mode)
 *        - To sum up: The memoized cache will be invalidated when the server restarts
 *          - When a new release is deployed (this ensures that a new deployment invalidates the cache for all running Lambda instances at once)
 *          - When a Lambda that serves the app is started
 *        - The cache is automatically invalidated after 1h (see memoizedCacheMaxAge). Thus ensuring that all Lambdas will be in-sync every hour or so,
 *          even when hot-fixes are deployed on Locize
 *    * Server's native cache:
 *      - Development:
 *        - There is no known server-side caching abilities while in development, and we don't want to cache the content while in development
 *      - Staging/production:
 *        - The server doesn't have any native caching abilities. We're running under Next.js serverless mode (AWS Lambda), which has a /tmp directory where we could write
 *          (See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48364250/write-to-tmp-directory-in-aws-lambda-with-python)
 *          But Next.js abstracts that away from us and we don't know how to write there. (would it be more efficient than the in-memory cache anyway?)
