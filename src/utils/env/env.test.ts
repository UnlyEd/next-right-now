/**
 * This test is meant to detect quickly when required ENV variables are missing.
 * We encourage you to list all your env variables to make sure you detect misconfiguration early.
 *
 * It was added after encountering this particular issue https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/13780
 * Where a missing env var would crash the "next build" locally, because of the particular behaviour of the "fetch" package
 * It can be hard to track down such misconfiguration, and it's a good practice to detect those as early as possible (and avoid deploying a misconfigured release)
