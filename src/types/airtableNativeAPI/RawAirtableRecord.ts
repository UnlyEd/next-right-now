 * Airtable record shaped the way the API returns it (AKA "raw")

 * A raw record doesn't have any dependency resolved.
 * All relationships are typed as string[], even for single items.
 * (yup, they designed their API that way, go figure)
 *
 * Raw airtable records aren't used by the application, not really.
 * They're mostly used/useful for testing because they represent real API data.
