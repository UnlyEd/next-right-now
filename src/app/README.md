> Check out the [documentation about the folder structure](../README.md#app-folder)

Summary:

- This folder is a way to organize what happens in `pages/_app`.
- It also contains app-wide configuration (constants).
- `Multiversal` means code executed "no matter what".
- Next Right Now `pages/_app` split the server and the browser code into 2 different files, to make it easier to understand.
