# Summary:
# Creates a new production deployment on Vercel's platform, when anything is pushed in the "master" branch.
# Once the deployment has been performed by Vercel, we wait for its status to reach the "READY" state before doing anything else.defaults:
# - Once ready, an HTTP call is sent to the webhook that is configured within the customer config file (VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETED_WEBHOOK). (optional)
# - Once ready, E2E tests are executed on the newly deployed domain (Cypress).
# - Once ready, quality tests are executed on the newly deployed domain (LightHouse).
#
# This workflow can also be triggered using "Workflow Dispatch".
#   See https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch
#   See https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch
# This workflow can also be triggered using the API (uses Workflow Dispatch in the background).

  # There are several ways to trigger Github actions - See https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#example-using-a-single-event for a comprehensive list:
  # - "push": Triggers each time a commit is pushed
  # - "pull_request": Triggers each time a commit is pushed within a pull request, it makes it much easier to write comments within the PR, but it suffers some strong limitations:
  #   - There is no way to trigger when a PR is merged into another - See https://github.community/t/pull-request-action-does-not-run-on-merge/16092?u=vadorequest
  #   - It won't trigger when the PR is conflicting with its base branch - See https://github.community/t/run-actions-on-pull-requests-with-merge-conflicts/17104/2?u=vadorequest
