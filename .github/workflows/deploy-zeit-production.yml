  # There are several ways to trigger Github actions - See https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#example-using-a-single-event for a comprehensive list:
  # - "push": Triggers each time a commit is pushed
  # - "pull_request": Triggers each time a commit is pushed within a pull request, it makes it much easier to write comments within the PR, but it suffers some strong limitations:
  #   - There is no way to trigger when a PR is merged into another - See https://github.community/t/pull-request-action-does-not-run-on-merge/16092?u=vadorequest
  #   - It won't trigger when the PR is conflicting with its base branch - See https://github.community/t/run-actions-on-pull-requests-with-merge-conflicts/17104/2?u=vadorequest
  push: # Triggers on each pushed commit
    branches:
      - 'master'

  # Allow manual trigger via a button in github or a HTTP call - See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#manually-running-a-workflow
