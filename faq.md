## How is the `i18nextInstance` passed to react?

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  **Question**: _I wanted to understand how the i18next integration works. How is the `i18nextInstance` passed to react? It seems to be passed to the `Layout` component, but the `Layout` component never uses it. So how does this work?_
</div>

- The `i18nextInstance` isn't necessary to perform translations actually, it's forwarded as a utility.
- Manipulating the `i18nextInstance` is not necessary, using `import { Trans, useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';` is what you'll need most of the time when translating content.
- The `i18next` library is actually initiated in `i18nextLocize.ts`
