## Contributing about documentation

Our documentation lives in the `docs/` folder. It is generated and hosted on Github Pages.

Only the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/tree/gh-pages) branch generates the online documentation. (it's our default branch)

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) behind the wheel, and [`just-the-docs`](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme for Jekyll.

---

### Installing Jekyll locally

In order to contribute to the docs, you may need to install Jekyll locally (especially for non-trivial changes).
Jekyll needs Ruby binary.

1. Install and configure Jekyll on your computer, follow [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
1. Once Jekyll is installed, you can install all Ruby gems using `yarn doc:gem:install`
1. Once gems are installed, you can run the local Jekyll server by using `yarn doc:start` which will start the server at localhost:4000

---

### Configuring Jekyll properly

Jekyll configuration uses 2 different files.
- [`docs/_config.yml`](docs/_config.yml) used by Github Pages
- [`docs/_config-development.yml`](docs/_config-development.yml) used by your local installation

There are a few, but important differences between both. The custom configuration must be written at the top of each config file.
The shared configuration must be written below.

> **Tip**: If you add custom/shared configuration, don't forget to update both config files, as needed.

### Known issues

- Using `yarn doc:start` will rebuild the whole documentation, but it's slower. Using `yarn doc:start:fast` won't rebuild the whole thing, and it's faster.
  If you're working on the navigation menu, be warned the fast mode won't apply changes, and your menu links won't update.

## Contributing about the source code

If you mean to contribute on any preset by adding a new feature, or update existing ones, etc. please see our [open RFC about contributing](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues/57).

Please open an issue first before contributing, so that we may discuss your contribution beforehand.
This isn't necessary for small changes, but non-trivial changes should be agreed upon first.

Also, if you provide a PR, please [configure CI on your GitHub repository](./guides/ci-cd/setup-github-actions.html) first, otherwise we'll need to "fork" (apply patch) your PR into NRN to test it first, and that takes extra time on us.

Additionally, please allow us to update your PR's code for easier collaboration.

## Requesting a new Preset

If you need a preset that isn't supported yet, you can request one through [Github issues](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues/new).

- Please check first if there isn't an **existing request**, you can use the [Github label `"request preset"`](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22request+preset%22) to filter them out.
- Please check first which presets [**won't be worked on by the NRN team**](./concepts/presets.html#which-presets-arent-being-considered) and must come from contributions.
