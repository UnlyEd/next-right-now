### Overview

| Preset | Diff PR | Pricing concerns |
|:-------|:--------|:-----------------|
| `{{preset}}` - [Branch](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/tree/{{preset}}) | [Compared to `v1-ssr-mst-aptd-gcms-lcz-sty`](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/pull/68) | [Not free (Locize)](../reference/vendors) |

It is very similar to [`v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty`](./v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty) which came out in July, 2020.
Which uses a REST-ish API (featuring Airtable vendor) instead of GraphQL (featuring GraphCMS vendor).

Depending on what you need/like the most (GraphQL vs REST), you may choose one or the other.

Please note `v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty` has since become the main preset, and provides a few very advanced features (e.g: Markdown as JSX), and a much better CMS (featuring Stacker CMS).

### Built-in features

### Clone locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now.git nrn-{{preset}} && cd nrn-{{preset}} && git checkout {{preset}}
```

This will create a `nrn-{{preset}}` folder in your current directory and checkout the `{{preset}}` git branch automatically.

Cloning it once is enough, but it may be simpler to use one clone per preset if you're trying out multiple presets locally :wink:
