### Overview

| Preset | Diff PR | Pricing concerns |
|:-------|:--------|:-----------------|
| `{{preset}}` - [Branch](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/tree/{{preset}}) | [Compared to `v2-mst-aptd-gcms-lcz-sty`](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/pull/86) | [Not free (Locize, Stacker)](../reference/vendors) |

It was released in July 2020 to take over [`v2-mst-aptd-gcms-lcz-sty`](./v2-mst-aptd-gcms-lcz-sty) preset and provides a few more features CMS-related.

In comparison, this preset features a built-in CMS (featuring Stacker) which plays very nicely with Airtable as a database (but can also use SalesForce and Google Sheets!).
Also, it features "Markdown as JSX" advanced use-case, which may be very handy.

### Built-in features

### Demo

### Built-in 3rd party vendors

### Clone locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now.git nrn-{{preset}} && cd nrn-{{preset}} && git checkout {{preset}}
```

This will create a `nrn-{{preset}}` folder in your current directory and checkout the `{{preset}}` git branch automatically.

Cloning it once is enough, but it may be simpler to use one clone per preset if you're trying out multiple presets locally :wink:
